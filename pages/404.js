        Ohno, seems like you've gotten lost my friend. Or maybe, you have found something you did not know you were looking for!
        In that case, let me tell you a story...
      </p>
      <div className='p-8 text-center'>
        <p className='text-center'>
          all about how,
          My life got flipped-turned upside down,
          And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
          I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.
        </p>
        <p className='text-center'>
          In West Philadelphia, born and raised
          On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
          Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool,
          And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school.
        </p>
        <p className='text-center'>
          When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
          Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.
          I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
          And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air."
        </p>
        <p className='text-center'>
          I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,
          The license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.
          If anything I could say that this cab was rare,
          But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air."
        </p>
        <p className='text-center pb-10'>
          I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,
          and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later."
          Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,
          To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
