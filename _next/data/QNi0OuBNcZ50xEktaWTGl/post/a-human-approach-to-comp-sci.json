The thesis is\nabout how automated negotiations could be made more 'fair', which required\nreading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided by my\nsupervisor. Me, being very excited to learn about something else than how to\nanalyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, started\nreading right away. \n\n\n## Humanities are weird\n\nTo my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy, there\nwere a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand, and there was\nnever a sense of 'arrival'; no, 'aha moment'. No problem, I'll just read more\nslowly and look up the terms! No, not so quick. It seems like everyone has their\nown definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain\nwork, and don't even get me started about the difference between the European\nand American usage of liberal.\n\nWhat I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it just seemed like my\nunderstanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount of seemed to\nsuggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a\nnever-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author\n_actually_ meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works,\nor books on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something\nI expected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research\npaper :confused:.\n\n\n## Computer science isn't human\n\nComputer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with a\nquestion, and follow some logic in order to arrive at an answer. This, I\nbelieve, is probably a result of computer science being a derivative of\nmathematics (back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics major,\ninstead of the more engineering oriented subject we know it as today) and other\nexact sciences. Of course this depends on which field in computer science you're\nexactly working in, but I think most people can agree that any computer\nscience paper (or even a tutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot\nmore confidence about the subject than a literary[?] work in humanities. \n\nHowever, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems like the\nway information in exact sciences is presented in a way that makes a bit _too\nmuch_ sense. We've all heard the math teacher tell us that \"You shouldn't just\nstudy the answers to the problem\". Instead, you should try and figure it out by\nmessing around, encountering dead ends, etc. Learning is messy. This, however,\nis the complete opposite of how information is presented in text books, papers,\ntextbooks. Giving students _and the general public_ the idea that if you can't\nfind the answer immediately, you're doing something wrong. Now, of course,\nresearchers, teachers and people who enjoyed a higher education know that this\nis not the case; they're familiar with the fact that learning is messy. But\n_this is not a given to anyone without a master's degree_, especially not for\nthe general public who just hear about 'another great scientific discovery'.\nBringing us to the 'messy' papers I had to read.\n\n\n## Humanities make sense\n\nPhilosophers are presenting the material exactly as how they're thinking about\nit; you're forced to think with them. Of course this doesn't make sense. Heck,\nwhen have your _raw thoughts_ ever made complete sense to another human being.\nMost of the time, you're forced to rephrase when talking to someone about a\ncomplex topic -not always of course, but the important thing is that it's never\na clear-cut logical argument; discussion is messy- and that's when you _really_\nhave to start thinking about what it is you want to say. That's when you're\nlearning. At least, according to _Richard Feynman_. \n\n> **Pick a topic**—Identify a subject you are unfamiliar with, and take an inventory\n> of what you know and what you don’t know; then, “fill in the gaps.” This could\n> be through self-study, attending lectures, listening to podcasts, etc.\n> \n> **Teach someone else**—After having compiled all that knowledge, simplify it as though you\n> will be explaining the topic to someone else. This step is really the key.\n> Plenty of studies have demonstrated that subjects learn better and retain more\n> knowledge when they are asked to teach what they’ve learned to someone else.\n> \n> **Simplify**—Work on removing jargon and overly technical terms from the explanation\n> by breaking down the material into simple terms using your own words. This helps\n> ensure that complex concepts don’t hide behind big words that won’t be fully\n> grasped.\n> \n> **Repeat**—Iteration is key here, as it is with so many processes.\n> Continuing to teach others the material and refine the teaching method will\n> improve retention and enforce mastery of the subject.\n>\n> — Richard Feynman\n\nPresenting your information in such a way that encourages the learning process\nas much as possible makes total sense. The value of your work inherently driving\nyour readers to think about what you're trying to say is something I think\nis vastly underestimated. Even if that means that the information isn't easily\ndigestible; sometimes it shouldn't be. Now, I don't want to do a simple\nappeal to authority saying that because some smart person said this is the best\nway to learn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some\nvalue in Feynman -considered by some one of the greatest teachers of all time-\nsuggesting this is the most important step in learning.\n\n## Computer science should strive to be more human\n\nSo, should we all abandon the current state of affairs and just start submitting\ndiaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides that just being a ridiculous\nproposition, I also made gross oversimplifications and generalizations; not all\nphilosophical write like I described before - definitely not all people\npracticing humanities. I do think should think more about how information is\npresented to people. Encouraging discussion is something that's not done enough\nin literature, and is not fixed with \"but that is left as an exercise to the\nreader\". There is a balance to be found between making something vague enough\nthat people...\n\n\nMaybe this is something only I experience or something that should've been made\nduring a university course[^1], but I have a feeling I'm not the only one. \n\n[^1]: Zohar from the future, they actually discussed this in a course regarding\n    the ethics of research. But this is something that should've been taught\n    from day 1. Showing students that doing research is a messy affair, makes\n    the barrier for experimentation much lower, which is incredibly important\n    for understanding a subject well.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
