The thesis is\nabout how automated negotiations could be made more 'fair', which required\nreading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided by my\nsupervisor. Me, being very excited to learn about something else than how to\nanalyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, started\nreading right away. \n\n\n## Humanities are weird\n\nTo my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy, there\nwere a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand, and there was\nnever a sense of 'arrival'; no, 'aha moment'. No problem, I'll just read more\nslowly and look up the terms! No, not so quick. It seems like everyone has their\nown definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain\nwork, and don't even get me started about the difference between the European\nand American usage of liberal.\n\nWhat I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it just seemed like my\nunderstanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount of seemed to\nsuggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a\nnever-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author\n_actually_ meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works,\nor books on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something\nI expected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research\npaper :confused:.\n\n\n## Computer science isn't human\n\nMy bet is that is comes from how knowledge in computer science (and exact\nsciences in general) is presented.\n\n\n## Humanities make sense\n\nPresenting information in a way that reflects its complexity and encouraging\ndiscussion by the way you write your work makes total sense. \n\n\n## Computer science should strive to be more human\n\nMaybe this is something only I experience or something that should've been made\nduring a university course[^1], but I have a feeling I'm not the only one.\n\n[^1]: Zohar from the future, they actually discussed this in a course regarding\n    the ethics of research. But this is something that should've been taught\n    from day 1. Showing students that doing research is a messy affair, makes\n    the barrier for experimentation much lower, which is incredibly important\n    for understanding a subject well.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
