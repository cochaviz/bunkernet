## Introduction

I'm currently working on my thesis as part of the final phase of my bachelor's
degree (fingers crossed that I'll be done this year :pray:). The thesis is
about how automated negotiations could be made more 'fair', which required
reading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided by my
supervisor. Me, being very excited to learn about something else than how to
analyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, started
reading right away. 


## Humanities are weird

To my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy, there
were a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand, and there was
never a sense of 'arrival'; no, 'aha moment'. No problem, I'll just read more
slowly and look up the terms! No, not so quick. It seems like everyone has their
own definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain
work, and don't even get me started about the difference between the European
and American usage of liberal.

What I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it just seemed like my
understanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount of seemed to
suggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a
never-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author
_actually_ meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works,
or books on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something
I expected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research
paper :confused:.


## Computer science isn't human

My bet is that is comes from how knowledge in computer science (and exact
sciences in general) is presented.


## Humanities make sense

Presenting information in a way that reflects its complexity and encouraging
discussion by the way you write your work makes total sense. 


## Computer science should strive to be more human

Maybe this is something only I experience or something that should've been made
during a university course[^1], but I have a feeling I'm not the only one.

[^1]: Zohar from the future, they actually discussed this in a course regarding
    the ethics of research. But this is something that should've been taught
    from day 1. Showing students that doing research is a messy affair, makes
    the barrier for experimentation much lower, which is incredibly important
    for understanding a subject well.
