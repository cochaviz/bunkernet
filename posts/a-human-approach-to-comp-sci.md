## Introduction

I'm currently working on my thesis as part of the final phase of my bachelor's
degree (fingers crossed that I'll be done this year :pray:). The thesis is
about how automated negotiations could be made more 'fair', which required
reading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided by my
supervisor. Me, being very excited to learn about something else than how to
analyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, started
reading right away. 


## Humanities are weird

To my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy, there
were a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand, and there was
never a sense of 'arrival'; no, 'aha moment'. No problem, I'll just read more
slowly and look up the terms! No, not so quick. It seems like everyone has their
own definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain
work, and don't even get me started about the difference between the European
and American usage of liberal.

What I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it just seemed like my
understanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount of seemed to
suggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a
never-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author
_actually_ meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works,
or books on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something
I expected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research
paper :confused:.


## Computer science isn't human

Computer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with a
question, and follow some logic in order to arrive at an answer. This, I
believe, is probably a result of computer science being a derivative of
mathematics (back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics major,
instead of the more engineering oriented subject we know it as today) and other
exact sciences. Of course this depends on which field in computer science you're
exactly working in, but I think most people can agree that any computer
science paper (or even a tutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot
more confidence about the subject than a literary[?] work in humanities. 

However, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems like the
way information in exact sciences is presented in a way that makes a bit _too
much_ sense. We've all heard the math teacher tell us that "You shouldn't just
study the answers to the problem". Instead, you should try and figure it out by
messing around, encountering dead ends, etc. Learning is messy. This, however,
is the complete opposite of how information is presented in text books, papers,
textbooks. Giving students _and the general public_ the idea that if you can't
find the answer immediately, you're doing something wrong. Now, of course,
researchers, teachers and people who enjoyed a higher education know that this
is not the case; they're familiar with the fact that learning is messy. But
_this is not a given to anyone without a master's degree_, especially not for
the general public who just hear about 'another great scientific discovery'.
Bringing us to the 'messy' papers I had to read.


## Humanities make sense

Philosophers are presenting the material exactly as how they're thinking about
it; you're forced to think with them. Of course this doesn't make sense. Heck,
when have your _raw thoughts_ ever made complete sense to another human being.
Most of the time, you're forced to rephrase when talking to someone about a
complex topic -not always of course, but the important thing is that it's never
a clear-cut logical argument; discussion is messy- and that's when you _really_
have to start thinking about what it is you want to say. That's when you're
learning. At least, according to _Richard Feynman_.

Presenting your information in such a way that encourages the learning process
as much as possible makes total sense. The value of your work inherently driving
your readers to think about what you're trying to say is something I think
is vastly underestimated. Even if that means that the information isn't easily
digestible; sometimes it shouldn't be. Now, I don't want to do a simple
appeal to authority saying that because some smart person said this is the best
way to learn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some
value in Feynman -considered by some one of the greatest teachers of all time-
suggesting this is the most important step in learning.

## Computer science should strive to be more human

So, should we all abandon the current state of affairs and just start submitting
diaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides that just being a ridiculous
proposition, I also made gross oversimplifications and generalizations; not all
philosophical write like I described before - definitely not all people
practicing humanities. I do think should think more about how information is
presented to people. Encouraging discussion is something that's not done enough
in literature, and is not fixed with "but that is left as an exercise to the
reader". There is a balance to be found between making something vague enough
that people...


Maybe this is something only I experience or something that should've been made
during a university course[^1], but I have a feeling I'm not the only one. 

[^1]: Zohar from the future, they actually discussed this in a course regarding
    the ethics of research. But this is something that should've been taught
    from day 1. Showing students that doing research is a messy affair, makes
    the barrier for experimentation much lower, which is incredibly important
    for understanding a subject well.
